	<h1>Time And Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm is</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a way to measure the space used by an algorithm, 
		for example O(n) in space complexity means algorithm use linear space as input side increase space used will increase linearly</p>
